# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis
## Overview
- The purpose of this project is to analyze data in R using a variety of scripts to compare car performance aross different metrics
## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

- Vehicle length and ground clearance provided a non-random amount of variance given their coeficients

Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

- The slope is not zero due to the small p-value

Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

- Our "Multiple R-Squared" value is roughly 71%, meaning this linear model is fairly effective in predicting mpg.

The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?
